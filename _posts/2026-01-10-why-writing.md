# Language limitations 
Humans often struggle to communicate their aesthetic impressions of something they have read, seen, heard, or played. This difficulty is a manifestation of the limitations of language itself: as a system that reflects real-world events, language frequently lacks the means to express feelings, or even more elevated forms of contemplative experience that have no widely recognized name in any language.
## Rebellion against language
This goes in line with Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas of language, which I mostly share. Nevertheless, where Wittgenstein stated that 
> whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent,

I find an opportunity to explore the world of ideals, with the hope that someday my words can reflect the contemplative word just from use, not from reference alone. This aspiration has its antecedents: I am sure you can recall a moment when something you read moved you to the point of tears. I have been working on this project from some time now, yet I think that the level of the goal we pursue through writing lies so far ahead that we may approach it indefinitely without reaching it in a lifetime. Those who come after us will be the ones to judge our sublimity. This the reason that makes me write, while practicing[^nonnative] the reach of my words.
## Writing blooms from the soul
Nevertheless, please do not misunderstand me: writing does not present itself as an externally imposed obligation.[^obligation] Instead, it presents itself as a natural expression of the soul, which I believe arises from our condition as contemplative beings. Fernando Pessoa describes this flourishing excellently in his poem "The Tobacco Shop",[^tobbaco] 
> The world is for those born to conquer it,
> Not for those who dream they can conquer it, even if they're right.
> I've done more in dreams than Napoleon.
> I've held more humanities against my hypothetical breast than Christ.
> I've secretly invented philosophies such as Kant never wrote.
> But I am, and perhaps will always be, the man in the garret,
> Even though I don't live in one.

where he reflects on how ideas emerge from people’s minds, roaming freely and departing after a time. Writing, then, is both the act and the result of attempting to capture the sublime through a physical net, with varying degrees of success, aiming not to be the man in the garret.
# Me, as a reading being
Before writing, one must read. Moreover, just as family members and teachers influence one’s personality and style, one’s trajectory as a reader can, to a certain degree, explain the path one will follow as a writer. Thus, in the interest of transparency regarding my motives, I will briefly describe my reading history.
## Starting as a science fiction reader
Just so you may know me better, my trajectory with books is broad. I began by reading science fiction, specially from Isaac Asimov. It was my uncle who first introduced me to reading, and at the time he himself was immersed in Asimov’s writing. Asimov was an astounding author, not only because of his skill as a storyteller, but also because he wrote across a wide range of subjects, far beyond fiction alone. As a result, I explored more of his work, including his books on the Greeks, the Egyptians, and real-world science. This, in turn, led me toward humanistic literature:poetry, philosophy, and related fields.

Asimov’s books do not merely present intriguing discoveries or technologies capable of radically transforming future societies; they also examine the philosophical and ethical implications of such advances. A clear example is the Foundation series, in which humanity develops a mathematical theory known as psychohistory. Its purpose is to predict historical events by analyzing the psychological behavior of entire populations, an idea that does not seem entirely implausible today, given ongoing advances in data analysis and large-scale computation.

These explorations, extending beyond speculative science, led me toward an even wider range of topics, which I will address below.

[^nonnative]: I also want to use this opportunity to practice my English writing. As a non-native English practitioner, who have read a couple of science fiction books and Shakespeare poems in English, I find this language captivating. Thus, following the footsteps of Borges, I desire to acquire competence in literary English, and German if possible. The academic English writing is completely different to the English that aims to captivate the mind. The former is committed to persuade, while the latter explores the unknown.
[^obligation]: There are cases where this does not apply, and it can be okay. For example, I often find myself trying to write till creativity exhaustion and beyond. I find this particularly good to improve the materialization of concepts through words, because this generally leads you to explore new concepts or writing techniques, and improves the ability to make the mundane transcend.
