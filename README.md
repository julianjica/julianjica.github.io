# About Me
I am a mathematician - physicist currently working as a research assistant for [Professor Tamayo](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1063486) at Harvard Business School. I am currently researching on topics of microeconomics like two-part tariffs, industrial organization, platforms' competition, among others. In my work I apply geometric and analytical tools to characterize Nash equilibriums, and also use computational tools to simulate the market behavior.
