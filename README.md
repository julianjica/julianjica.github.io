# About Me
I am a mathematician - physicist currently working as a research assistant for [Professor Tamayo](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1063486) at Harvard Business School. I am currently researching on topics of microeconomics like two-part tariffs, industrial organization, platforms' competition, among others. In my work I apply geometric and analytical tools to characterize Nash equilibriums, and also use computational tools to simulate the market behavior.

While living in Bogota (Colombia), I earned a B.Sc. in Physics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia and concurrently earned a B.Sc. in Mathematics at Fundaci√≥n Universitaria Konrad Lorenz. I also acquired a M.Sc. in Mathematics at Universidad de los Andes.

In addition to my research experience, I also taught Bachelor level courses in Mathematics like Integral Calculus, Differential Equations and Scientific Computing.
