# About Me
I am a mathematician - physicist currently working as a research assistant for [Professor Tamayo](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1063486) at Harvard Business School. I am currently researching on topics of microeconomics like two-part tariffs, industrial organization, platforms' competition, among others. In my work I apply geometric and analytical tools to characterize Nash equilibriums, and also use computational tools to simulate the market behavior.

While living in Bogota (Colombia), I earned a B.Sc. in Physics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia and concurrently earned a B.Sc. in Mathematics at Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz. I also acquired a M.Sc. in Mathematics at Universidad de los Andes.

In addition to my research experience, I also taught Bachelor level courses in Mathematics like Integral Calculus, Differential Equations and Scientific Computing.

- *Dynamic Competition for Customer Memberships*

This paper analyzes a two-period membership market with two symmetric firms charging a membership fee, allowing consumers to buy products or services at a given price. Firms can offer short-term (ST) or long-term (LT) memberships. When firms employ LT memberships, they have incentives to prevent their old customers from being poached by competitors and price-discriminate them based on purchase behavior. Conversely, ST memberships lead to no unit price discrimination for old customers, but instead, they lead to membership fee discrimination, increasing the share of switchers. We find that, under general assumptions, ST memberships are offered in equilibrium. This result is robust to various extensions, including switching coupons or discounts, naive consumers, sunk costs, and asymmetric differentiation parameters. We find that firms are indifferent between ST and LT memberships only when the customer's switching coupon or discount is high relative to the transportation cost.

- *About the restricted three-body problem with the Schwarschild de Sitter potential*  
John A. Arredondo, **Julian Jimenez-Cardenas**  
[Nonlinear Dynamics and Systems Theory, Volume 21, Number 2.](https://e-ndst.kiev.ua/v21n2.htm)

In this paper the restricted three body problem in the context of Schwarszchild-de Sitter’s space-time is studied. The equations of motion that govern the bodies are derived using the Schwarszchild-de Sitter metric, by introducing a set known as the parameter domain, the existence of equilibrium points for any element of this set is shown. The stability conditions for the orbital motion of the system are established by the analysis of the eigenvalues of the linearized system.

- *Strategy for Multiunit Organizations*

**Julian Jimenez-Cardenas**, Jorge Tamayo

This article delves into the strategic dynamics of organizational decision-making amidst varying information symmetries between firms and managers. We discuss the critical interplay between communication efficiency, misalignment costs, and profitability, emphasizing the importance of effective communication channels in aligning managerial decisions with organizational objectives. Our findings underscore the strategic management of resources by firms, highlighting the significance of optimizing communication efficiency to empower managers and enhance organizational agility, and increasing the independence of the managers when the firm is uncertain about their situation.

- *Generalists: on the organizational benefits of broad skilling*

Achyuta Adhvaryu, **Julian Jimenez-Cardenas**, Anant Nyshadham, Jorge Tamayo

This paper investigates the optimal allocation of time across tasks within a firm when task importance is uncertain. We develop a model where the importance of each task follows a stochastic process, reflecting random fluctuations in demand or input requirements. Under this framework, we derive the optimal allocation strategy, accounting for the trade-off between efficiency and adaptability in production. Our results show that, in stochastic settings, firms allocate more time to less productive tasks while specializing in highly productive ones. Compared to deterministic environments, optimal production under uncertainty is lower, reflecting the costs of variability. When uncertainty is high, the firm adopts a generalized approach across most tasks, reserving specialization for tasks of the highest productivity. These findings offer new insights into how firms balance flexibility and efficiency in the face of uncertainty, highlighting the interplay between stochastic task importance and production decisions.
