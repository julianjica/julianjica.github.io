#  About  Me
## Academic
I am a mathematician - physicist currently working as a senior researcher for [Professor Tamayo](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1063486), formally contracted through [Good Business Lab](https://goodbusinesslab.org/), and part of the [Digital Reskilling Lab](https://d3.harvard.edu/digital-reskilling/) at Harvard Business School. 

My primary research interests lie in strategy, with a strong emphasis on microeconomic theory. In particular, my work engages with topics such as two-part tariffs, industrial organization, and platform competition, among related areas. I use my mathematical background to employ geometric and analytical methods to develop novel theoretical models capturing a wide range of business and microeconomic environments, to determine potential equilibria, and to employ computational tools to simulate market behavior and empirically assess model predictions using data.

Regarding my academic background, I earned a B.Sc. in Physics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, alongside a concurrent B.Sc. in Mathematics from Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz. I subsequently obtained an M.Sc. in Mathematics from Universidad de los Andes.

In addition to my research activities, I have teaching experience at the undergraduate level, having instructed courses in Mathematics such as Integral Calculus, Differential Equations, and Scientific Computing at both Universidad de los Andes and Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.
## Personal
Beyond my academic roles, I enjoy reading and swimming, and I make a regular effort to practice CrossFit. In recent years, I have also developed an interest in writing poetry and essays, some of which are available on my [Blog](year-archive.html).
