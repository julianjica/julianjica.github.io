### Course description
Computación Científica I is an undergraduate course in the Mathematics program aimed at introducing scientific computing techniques for solving computationally intensive problems in science. The course focuses on the use of Python as a programming language for scientific applications and emphasizes good programming practices.

The general objective is to introduce students to basic Python programming tools as computational instruments for solving scientific computing problems.

### Main topics
- Introduction to scientific computing and scientific software  
- Basic Python programming: variables, data types, control flow, functions, and input/output  
- Python scientific libraries: NumPy (arrays, linear algebra, statistics, random sampling, Fourier transform)  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib (2D, 3D plots, contour plots, heat maps)  
- Scientific computing with SciPy: numerical integration, ordinary differential equations, interpolation, optimization, and root finding  
- Development of a computational project
